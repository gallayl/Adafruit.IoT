# Adafruit.IoT
Adafruit library for Windows IoT and Raspberry Pi 2/3

API documentation is here: https://mjmeans.github.io/Adafruit.IoT/doc/

NuGet package is here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Adafruit.IoT/1.0.3

## Notes

I only have the Motor HAT #2348. So consequently this library only supports the Motor HAT #2348 at this time. However, the namespace is organized as a framework for later expansion to include other Adafruit Raspberry Pi HAT's. If you'd like to see other Adafruit HATs added, please request it. If you'd like to contribute, please folow the standard github process (fork the repo, create a branch for your contribution, send a pull request).

If you'd like to support this project and the addition of support for other Adafruit HATs, please donate money.
